0.11 (2016-02-26)

Changes by Wojtek Kaniewski <wojtekka@toxygen.net>:
- changed license to GPL version 2. There was no license information before
  which caused confusion. Code by Tomasz Lipski <lemur@irc.pl> and awayzzz
  <awayzzz@digibel.org> had to be removed, because their e-mail addresses
  were dead and googling for them gave no useful information. The missing
  features have been rewritten from scratch. If any offending code is still
  here, please let me know. I've done my best, but I haven't used any
  version control 5 years ago,
- changed e-mail address,
- ignore IPv4/IPv6 address hints when option -H is present.

Changes by Ramunas Lukosevicius <lukoramu@parok.lt>
- fixed source mapping bug,
- SIGHUP reloads map file.

Changes by Roland Stigge <stigge@antcom.de>

  local/source and remote hint (AF_INET/AF_INET6).

- correct option -f.

0.10 (2003-06-12)

  data. unsent data is stored in a buffer,
- autoconf,
- supports pid file (idea by misio <monster@qm.pl>).
